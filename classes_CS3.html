                    <p>
                    Welcome to AP Computer Science Independent Study! 
                    <br> Students will be able to select various projects 
                    during the school year to work on. These can be ones of 
                    their own that they want to do (it must be approved) 
                    or they can choose one or more of my projects.
                    <br>
                    <br>You will have to work on a project for 5 hours 
                    (120 lines) each week! Due by Friday evening, you will need to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Type up a summary of what you have done for the week. 
                        It does not have to be elaborate. You will also
                        need to turn in your code in an ASCII file (text file),
                        or snapshot of your code academy progress (show percent,
                        the entire screen with an icon and url showing)
                        An assignment turned in late by a week or more will be docked 
                        5 points per week. Please DO NOT give me your code in a 
                        wordprocessor, pdf, zip, or other format. Compilers 
                        need text files (ASCII). There are also labs 
                        that you can complete in most any language on 
                        my PythonHelp website. </li>
                        <li>You will email me your progress. In the subject 
                        line please put:  
                        <br> Your full name  Period. ?  Week ?
                        <br> Please attach the code file(s), NOT zipped or pdf 
                        or word, in ASCII. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    Any grade that is over a week late will have 5 points 
                    deducted, unless a medical excuse or excused absences.
                    <br> THE CODE SHOULD COMPILE AND RUN!

                                You may choose your own project or follow my path.
                                You may choose to follow my path of study or select a 
                                project(s) that you would like to work on.  If you 
                                choose your own project, it must be heavy on the programming.  
                                You must also produce ALL the code that you wrote for me. For 
                                example, let's say you want to learn a new programming language 
                                like C++.  Your project must contain several programs that 
                                you write that will demonstrate your understanding of C++.  
                                You can't just say at the end of the grading period "Oh, I have 
                                been studying C++". All of your code should be saved in files and 
                                turned in as part of your project. A list of requirements is 
                                shown below. 
                                <br> (All code should solve a problem)

                            to music during lab time.

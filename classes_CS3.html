                    <p>
                    Welcome to AP Computer Science Independent Study! 
                    <br> Students will be able to select various projects 
                    during the school year to work on. These can be ones of 
                    their own that they want to do (it must be approved) 
                    or they can choose one or more of my projects.
                    <br>
                    <br>You will have to work on a project for 5 hours 
                    (120 lines) each week! Due by Friday evening, you will need to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Type up a summary of what you have done for the week. 
                        It does not have to be elaborate. You will also
                        need to turn in your code in an ASCII file (text file),
                        or snapshot of your code academy progress (show percent,
                        the entire screen with an icon and url showing)
                        An assignment turned in late by a week or more will be docked 
                        5 points per week. Please DO NOT give me your code in a 
                        wordprocessor, pdf, zip, or other format. Compilers 
                        need text files (ASCII). There are also labs 
                        that you can complete in most any language on 
                        my PythonHelp website. </li>
                        <li>You will email me your progress. In the subject 
                        line please put:  
                        <br> Your full name  Period. ?  Week ?
                        <br> Please attach the code file(s), NOT zipped or pdf 
                        or word, in ASCII. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    Any grade that is over a week late will have 5 points 
                    deducted, unless a medical excuse or excused absences.
                    <br> THE CODE SHOULD COMPILE AND RUN!

                            <br> Required Materials: A binder/folder to 
                            hold notes we take in class and various handouts.

                            <br> Grading Policy:  Your grade will be determined on the 
                            following scale: 
                            <br> - WEEKLY GRADE: 100%
                            <bf> </bf>A late grade will be deducted per week for late 
                            assignments (-5 points per week).  Late work will NOT be 
                            accepted once the marking period is over.
                            <br>
                            <br> Retest Policy/Extra Credit:  Every student will 
                            be allowed to redo one of the weekly grades if it is a 
                            failing grade (each marking period). The maximum grade earned is a 70. 
                            This must be done by the end of the marking period!
                            <br>
                            <br> Lab Discipline: While in the computer lab students should
                            be engaged in working on their projects.  They are required 
                            to adhere to the Responsible Use Guidelines for the High School 
                            as presented in the Student Handbook.  
                            <br>
                            <br> Cell Phone Policy: Per the Student Handbook: “Students 
                            are not permitted to display, turn on, or use a personal 
                            device during instructional class period.” With teacher 
                            permission, students can access personal devices to listen 
                            to music during lab time. 
                            <br>
                            <br> Dishonesty: Cheating on projects will result in the 
                            student receiving a zero on the project, a call to parents, and 
                            a Tier 1 Honor Code violation. Repeated cheating or cheating 
                            on a project is a Tier 2 violation.

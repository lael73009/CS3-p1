                    Welcome to AP Computer Science!  
                    <br> Students will be introduced to a new way of 
                    thinking about computers as they learn to think 
                    as a computer thinks.  The Java programming language
                    will be the medium used to teach students a variety 
                    of computer science concepts and introductory data
                    structures. Java is an Object Oriented Programming 
                    language and the concept of objects and classes are 
                    introduced early on in the lessons. Students will 
                    write interactive programs to achieve a specific 
                    outcome thereby enhancing their critical thinking 
                    skills and problem solving ability. The AP Computer 
                    Science test uses the Java programming language. 
                    The topics we will cover are listed below:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Declaration of Variables and Assignment </li>
                        <li>Arithmetic Operations (*,  /,  %,  +, -) </li>
                        <li>Comparison Operators (>,  >=,  <,  <=,  ==,  !=) </li>
                        <li>Reading in data from the keyboard and a File </li>
                        <li>Methods (calling and writing your own) </li>
                        <li>If, if else, switch </li>
                        <li>For loops, while loops, do while loops </li>
                        <li>Methods </li>
                        <li>Nested loops </li>
                        <li>Arrays (1d and 2d) </li>
                        <li>ArrayList </li>
                        <li>Sorting and Searching </li>
                        <li>Recursion </li>

                            Textbook: A+ Plus Computer Science by 
                            Stacey Armstrong will be used for lesson slides and labs. 
                            This resource is in electronic format and will be pushed out 
                            to students through Google Classroom and the Student Shared drive. 
                            <br> 
                            <br> Required Materials: A binder/folder to hold notes we take 
                            in class and various handouts. There is a $0.00 lab fee associated 
                            with this class. 
                            <br>
                            <br> Grading Policy / Homework: Your grade will be 
                            determined on the following scale:
                            <br> - Tests:                  70%
                            <br> - Labs/Quizzes/Homework:  30%
                            <br>
                            <br>Tests consist of two parts: multiple choice (80% of grade) 
                            and free response (20% of grade). We have quizzes occasionally 
                            and there is a minimal amount of homework. Lab work is
                            completed in the classroom or at home if you are remote.
                            <br>
                            <br> Assignments must be turned in by the assignment date!  
                            No labs will be accepted after the end of the marking period!  
                            There are no new labs the last week of the marking period 
                            (other than optional extra credit labs).
                            <br>
                            <br> Retest Policy/Extra Credit:  Every student will be allowed 
                            to retest one test grade per 9 week marking period. The maximum 
                            grade earned on a retest is a 70. The retest grade is based 
                            solely on redoing the multiple choice portion of the test. 
                            Most lessons include extra credit lab assignments that students
                             can work on if they are finished with the required lab assignments. 
                             Extra credit lab assignments earn a minimum grade of 110.
                            <br>Lab Discipline:  No food or drinks are allowed in the computer 
                            lab!  While in the computer lab students should be engaged in 
                            working on their lab assignments and not on the internet. They 
                            are required to adhere to the Responsible Use Guidelines for the 
                            High School as presented in the Student Handbook.
                            <br>
                            <br> Cell Phone Policy: Per the Student Handbook: 
                            “Students are not permitted to display, turn on, or use a personal 
                            device during instructional class period.” With teacher permission, 
                            students can access personal devices to listen to music during lab time. 
                            <br>
                            <br> Dishonesty: Cheating on lab assignments will result in the 
                            student receiving a zero on the assignment, a call to parents, 
                            and a Tier 1 Honor Code violation. Repeated cheating or cheating 
                            on a test is a Tier 2 violation.
                            <br>

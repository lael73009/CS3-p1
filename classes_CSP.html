                        Welcome to Computer Science Principles AP! 
                       <br> AP Computer Science Principles is a college-level 
                       course designed to introduce students to the fundamental 
                       concepts of computer science and computational thinking. 
                       The course aims to provide students with a broad understanding 
                       of the diverse applications of computing and its impact 
                       on society. It does not focus solely on programming, but 
                       also covers a wide range of topics related to computer science. 
                       Some of the key components typically included in the course 
                       are: computational thinking practices, big ideas, exploring 
                       and creating tasks, the impact of computing, assesment, and 
                       collaboration.Through this collaborative, learner-centric 
                       approach, students are encouraged to explore the 
                       advantages and societal impact of computational technology 
                       while developing their own programming and computational 
                       thinking skills. It is required for students have daily 
                       access to the internet. The units are listed below:

                            Stacey Armstrong (Slide shows, Labs, and Worksheets).  
                            Plus some of our own problems and help files.

                            <br> Grading Policy / Homework:  Your grade will 
                            be determined on the following scale:
                            <br> - Tests:                      70%
                            <br> - Labs / Quizzes / Homework:  30%
                            <br>
                            <br>Tests consist of two parts: multiple choice (80% 
                            of grade) and free response (20% of grade). We have quizzes 
                            occasionally and there is a minimal amount of homework. 
                            Lab work is completed in the classroom or at home.
                            <br>
                            <br>Assignments must be turned in by the assignment 
                            date!  No labs will be accepted after the end of the marking 
                            period!  There are no new labs the last week of the marking 
                            period (other than optional extra credit labs).
                            <br>
                            <br>Retest Policy/Extra Credit:  Every student will be 
                            allowed to retest one test grade per 9 week marking period.
                            The maximum grade earned on a retest is a 70. The retest 
                            grade is based solely on redoing the multiple choice portion
                            of the test. Most lessons include extra credit lab assignments
                            that students can work on if they are finished with the 
                            required lab assignments. Extra credit lab assignments 
                            earn a minimum grade of 110.

                            <br>Lab Discipline:  No food or drinks are allowed in the 
                            computer lab!  While in the computer lab students should be 
                            engaged in working on their lab assignments and not on the internet. 
                            They are required to adhere to the Responsible Use Guidelines for the 
                            High School as presented in the Student Handbook
                            <br>
                            <br>Cell Phone Policy:   Per the Student Handbook: “Students 
                            are not permitted to display, turn on, or use a personal device 
                            during instructional class period.” With teacher permission, 
                            students can access personal devices to listen to music during 
                            lab time. 
                            <br>
                            <br>Dishonesty:  Cheating on lab assignments will result 
                            in the student receiving a zero on the assignment, a call 
                            to parents, and a Tier 1 Honor Code violation. Repeated 
                            cheating or cheating on a test is a Tier 2 violation.

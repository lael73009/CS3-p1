                <p> This is my 40th+ year of teaching 
                    and my 37th year of teaching Computer Science.  
                    I was born and raised in Michigan and I 
                    received a Math degree from Michigan State 
                    University.  I later received my Computer 
                    Science degree from The University of Texas at Dallas.  
                    I have also worked at Texas Instruments and SchoolsOPEN. 
                    My wife, Kelly, is also a teacher at West 
                    Ridge Middle School (Science).  My daughter, 
                    Shannon, is a graduate of Westlake High School  
                    and is now a teacher at Forest Trail Elementary

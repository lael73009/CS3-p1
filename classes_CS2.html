                    Welcome to Computer Science 2 Advanced!  
                    <br> This course will contain a review of 
                    the first year topics as well as many new topics.
                    Students will write interactive programs to achieve a 
                    specific outcome thereby enhancing their critical 
                    thinking skills and problem solving ability. 
                    The AP Computer Science test uses the Java programming 
                    language and may be taken at the end of the course.
                    The topics we will cover are listed below:
                    </p>

                            Textbook: A+ Plus Computer Science by Stacey Armstrong 
                            will be used for lesson slides and labs. This resource 
                            is in electronic format and will be pushed out to students 
                            through Google Classroom.
                            <br>
                            <br> Required Materials: A binder/folder to hold notes 
                            we take in class and various handouts. There is a 
                            $0.00 lab fee associated with this class. 
                            <br>
                            <br> Grading Policy / Homework:  Your grade will be 
                            determined on the following scale:
                            <br> - Tests:                     70%
                            <br> - Labs / Quizzes / Homework: 30%
                            <br>
                            <br> Tests consist of two parts: multiple choice (
                            80% of grade) and free response (20% of grade). We have 
                            quizzes occasionally and there is a minimal amount of 
                            homework. Lab work is completed in the classroom or at 
                            home if you need additional time.
                            <br>
                            <br> Assignments must be turned in by the assignment date!  
                            No labs will be accepted after the end of the marking period!  
                            There are no new labs the last week of the marking period 
                            (other than optional extra credit labs).
                            <br>
                            <br> Retest Policy/Extra Credit: Every student will be 
                            allowed to retest one test grade per 9 week marking period. 
                            The maximum grade earned on a retest is a 70. The retest 
                            grade is based solely on redoing the multiple choice portion 
                            of the test. Most lessons include extra credit lab assignments 
                            that students can work on if they are finished with the 
                            required lab assignments. Extra credit lab assignments 
                            earn a minimum grade of 110.
                            <br>
                            <br> Lab Discipline: No food or drinks are allowed in the 
                            computer lab!  While in the computer lab students should be 
                            engaged in working on their lab assignments and not on the internet. 
                            They are required to adhere to the Responsible Use Guidelines 
                            for the High School as presented in the Student Handbook
                            <br>
                            <br> Cell Phone Policy: Per the Student Handbook: “Students are 
                            not permitted to display, turn on, or use a personal device during 
                            instructional class period.” With teacher permission, students 
                            can access personal devices to listen to music during lab time. 
                            <br>
                            <br> Dishonesty: Cheating on lab assignments will result in 
                            the student receiving a zero on the assignment, a call to 
                            parents, and a Tier 1 Honor Code violation. Repeated cheating or 
                            cheating on a test is a Tier 2 violation.
                            <br>
